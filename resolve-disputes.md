# Become a Resolver

A key part of HJAELP's decentralized service marketplace is our answer to this question: 

**What happens when clients and service providers disagree?**

If you've hired people or been a service provider yourself, you've been there. It seems so great at the beginning. Then something doesn't go according to plan.

Maybe an unforeseen circumstance causes the work to take longer than the service provider thought.

Maybe the client sees the final product and starts realizing all the ways it could be improved, or maybe wasn't done up to their expectations.

Disputes will happen, but what sets us apart is how we deal with them.

That's where the community comes in.

## HJAELP's decentralized dispute resolution system

In legacy marketplaces like Upwork, their employees unilaterally arbitrate disputes based on opaque rules and processes. 

At HJAELP, the community arbitrates disputes by following a clear, transparent, fair process. When a disagreement arises, we trust our community to understand the evidence and make fair and thoughtful decisions about how to come to a resolution.

In HJAELP's ultimate version, this entire process will take place on-chain. Resolvers will be able to decide disputes directly from the dispute resolution dApp, in a completely decentralized way. In this way, we can improve the quality of decisions while increasing the system's throughput.

We believe this is a crucial "coordination lego block" that other decentralized organizations will need as well. We will release it for general use once we've built the protocol out for ourselves.

### How disputes get resolved

The HJAELP community elects Resolvers that represent HJAELPers, clients, investors, and validators. Under the direction of a community-elected Chief Resolver, Resolvers review the evidence and offer expert opinions on subjective claims in order to come to an agreement. This ensures decisions are fair and unbiased. 

### Dispute resolution in 4 steps

Each dispute has four phases in HJAELP's resolution system.

#### 1. Start a conversation in good faith
Most disputes can be resolved with a simple conversation. HJAELP makes this easy by enabling direct messaging inside the platform, allowing direct communication between both parties. Before starting a formal dispute resolution process, HJAELP helps both sides come to a mutually agreed-upon decision that keeps both sides happy.

#### 2. Register a dispute
If either party want to dispute an invoice, they can register a dispute by submitting a short form specifying the reason for the dispute and the basis for the dispute. Each dispute must start with a statement as well as supporting evidence. A community-elected representative then works with the person to help complete the right documentation and provide proper notification to the other party.

#### 3. If we can't reach agreement, the community takes over
Once complete, the dispute is passed to the disputant, who can either accept the terms of the dispute or file a counterdispute to gather and present their side of the story. Both sides have plenty of time to reach a mutually agreed-upon resolution. However, if they still don't agree, the community-elected Chief Resolver will convene the Resolvers and any eyewitnesses to participate in the dispute.

#### 4. Resolver vote, enactment period & time lock
Skilled community members will act as expert witnesses and review subjective statements (for example, "this job wasn't done very well for the amount billed") and offer their opinions. After reviewing the full documentation, a committee of Resolvers elected by the community will issue a decision.

### Why become a Resolver?

Resolvers and Chief Resolvers receive HJAELPCOIN tokens when they complete dispute resolution tasks. Each receives tokens when:
- They are elected to their post
- They complete the mandatory dispute resolution training course
- They participate in a dispute case and issue judgements

Being a Resolver can be a great way to contribute to the HJAELP community and earn tokens for your efforts.

### How do I become a Resolver?

More information on how to become a Resolver will become available as we build out the system (see the [roadmap](./roadmap.md)).
