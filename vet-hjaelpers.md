# Become a Validator

Validators are our name for the members of the NAETION community who help us find and vet talented service providers (QUESTers). 

A Validator's job consists of two steps: Finding and vetting. 

## Level 1: Finding future QUESTers

In level 1 of NAETION's Validator program, anyone can sign up, receive their unique code, and start inviting their network to NAETION. In return, when someone they invite becomes either a QUESTers or a client, the Validator receives 1% of their total payments (earned or paid), awarded in NAETION ($NTN). The NAETION Validator protocol will do this programmatically.

This referral system, too, is a "coordination lego block" that other organizations will want to use. We plan to make it available for them after we build it for ourselves.

## Level 2: Vetting QUESTers

At NAETION, we are committed to maintaining a high bar for talent. This is crucial for maintaining NAETION's reputation among clients as the place to go when you need to hire someone great. So when a new service provider applies to join NAETION, we have a thorough vetting process to make sure they meet our quality bar. 

Community members can apply to become Level 2 Validators (L2s), which means they are the ones who conduct this vetting process. The steps in the vetting process are as follows:

#### 1. Look at online reputation sources

Often, a service provider will have reviews on other sites. Our L2s will comb through the data to understand how the service provider stacks up against the current top QUESTers.

#### 2. Reference check

L2s are tasked with asking for references and calling them up, going through a set of questions optimized to uncover information critical to making the right decision about a candidate.

#### 3. Interview

L2s also conduct interviews of candidates, again using a set of questions optimized to increase the odds of success. This is the final step before acceptance as a QUESTers.

#### 4. Review

Every now and then, a QUESTers might get a poor review. It's the L2's job, then, to understand the situation by talking to both the QUESTers and the client. Their goal is to come to a decision about whether the QUESTers needs support or whether corrective action needs to be taken. They will work with the NAETION internal team to create a plan and engage in a course of action based on the information at hand.

## Becoming a Validator

Once the referral system is live, anyone can become a Level 1 Validator and start earning passive income by inviting their network to NAETION. 

L2s earn NAETION ($NTN) tokens for completing each of the tasks involved in vetting QUESTers and making sure our clients will have the highest chance of having an amazing experience every time.
